all i do is im going to be working for you folks.
here is my statement.
he didnt win anything.
before we discuss the paris accord, i’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since election day on november 8th.
he also wanted to be secretary of state i said "no thanks."
because of the new business climate that we’re creating, jobs are already starting to pour back in — companies like sprint, intel, exxon-mobile — where a great man, rex tillerson, is doing an incredible job — (applause) — ran that company for many years and ran it well.
thank you.
#trump2016 thank you!

at 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which i expect, we need all forms of available american energy, or our country — (applause) — will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the american family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.

@kaplunm        "@realdonaldtrump thoughts on snowden being granted asylum in russia?"
and they showed hillary clinton  hers is very close.
so when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually — in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank.
we're going to make great deals and fair deals and get along great with japan.

@dbzoptimist: most people in the us want @realdonaldtrump to be president...really nice.

....chariman kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country and only the united states with me as president can make that vision come true.

@jamesholt52 @realdonaldtrump we need someone to lead the party strong person behind the man that is your strength thank you.
@brithume @bretbaier
i dont know what report current director of the fbi christopher wray was reading but it sure wasnt the one given to me.
dojs emails &amp; notes show bruce ohrs connection to (phony &amp; discredited) trump dossier.
and we’ve just started on that one.
why can't the leaders of the republican party see that i am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger stronger party!
they will soon!
the enthusiasm blows away our rivals on the radical left.
isn't that what you want for your president?
@the_life_of_dg: @realdonaldtrump you know how to lead!
if he actually read the biased mueller report composed by 18 angry dems who hated trump....
....he would see that it was nevertheless strong on no collusion and ultimately no obstruction...anyway how do you obstruct when there is no crime and in fact the crimes were committed by the other side?
it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media.
if this is the new standard every president from here on out is impeachable.
unbroken.
over the last 15 years iran has gained more....

lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the g.q.
we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the state of california which is well known or its poor management &amp; high taxes!
in other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job.
- far better vision than the others
i am interviewed on this week on @abc this morning.
going up fast.
iran is toying with our president - buying time and laughing at the stupidity of our leadership.

we must simplify the tax code and start making our own products again to bring our jobs back from overseas.
@moviesharkd: must see" interview!
and they take our jobs and a lot of other things.
thank you!
we got to reduce it.
they had no intention of having a proper investigation.
look, i disavowed.
then they said, "well, hell never sign and hell never file his financials because who knows, maybe hes not as rich as people think."
we have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but i still hate to see whats happening.
